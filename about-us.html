        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to The Cookie Shoppe, your destination for irresistible cookies made with love! We are a small, family-owned business passionate about creating the most delicious cookies for our customers.</p>
        <p>Our story began in a humble kitchen where our founder, Sarah, spent countless hours perfecting her cookie recipes. With a deep love for baking and a commitment to using only the finest ingredients, Sarah's cookies quickly gained popularity among friends and family.</p>
        <p>Encouraged by the overwhelming positive feedback, Sarah decided to turn her passion into a business and The Cookie Shoppe was born. Today, we proudly serve our freshly-baked cookies to customers both locally and nationwide, delivering smiles with every bite.</p>

        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>Our team at Cookie Shop is made up of a group of passionate bakers who share the same love for cookies. With years of experience and a commitment to excellence, our team works tirelessly to ensure that every cookie that leaves our kitchen is a true masterpiece.</p>
